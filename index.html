        <h1>Nice Title</h1>
        <p>(laughs) And who's gonna make us, tender-foot...you? I am. (Buford turns to see Marshall Strickland with a rifle aimed at Buford's shoulder.) Marshall Strickland. I didn't know you was back in town. If you can't read the sign, Tannen, I presume you can read this. (He pats his rifle.) Pretty tough hombre when you're pointin' a scattergun at a man's back.(Later) (Marty is reading the letter aloud and Doc is looking at the circuit control microchip though a magnifying glass.) "...As you can see, the lightning bolt shorted out the time circuit control microchip. The attached she-she..." Schematic. "...schematic diagram will allow you to build a replacement unit with the 1955 components, thus restoring the time machine to perfect working order."</p>

        <p>(Doc spots Clara talking with some people and he smiles. Clara looks up and sees him and she smiles back. She walks over to him.) Good evening. Evening. You look very...nice. Thank you.(Marty #2, who remains throughout this movie, races into view and runs toward the Doc who is still dancing.) Doc! Doc! Doc! DOC! DOC! (Doc stops dancing and turns around and sees Marty. He freaks out.) AHH! Okay, relax Doc, it's me, it's me, it's Marty!</p>
